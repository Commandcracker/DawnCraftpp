description = """Complementary Shaders v4 is a Minecraft Java Edition shader pack based on Capt Tatsu's "BSL Shaders". The goal of Complementary v4 is being good at everything. Performance, gameplay, beauty, compatibility; you name it. Complementary v4 will try to provide you with the most issueless experience possible within limitations of the shader pipeline. It runs reasonably fast, supports almost every GPU and driver, works well with mods that no one thought a shader pack could be compatible with, fixes problems that no other shader packs addressed before, doesn't disturb you with excessive effects, and most importantly, it looks good according to the users."""
